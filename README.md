## Release Notes

### 1.1.0

Enhanced the error-handling, by ensuring
that the provided folder name isn't empty,
and the path is therefore correct.

Fixed the incorrect message of a folder
being created, which showed "C:/" instead
of the actual root folder.

### 1.0.0

Initial release of the Directory Manager,
added the ability to add a new folder to the
workspace by running the "Create a new folder"
command.
